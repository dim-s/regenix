> Welcome to Regenix Framework Documentation

---

#### Overview
Regenix is a classic MVC web-framework for PHP. General goals of our project are
fast and effective development with REST architecture.

#### How use documentation ?
If you are reading this article via GitHub for learning about Regenix, stop it! 
To learn about the framework, use your web-server and an installed copy of Regenix.

Regenix has a special application - `.documentation` and you can open it by using
a browser, it will be available at `localhost/@documentation` or `<address_your_webserver>/@documentation`.

> **WARNING**: In producation stage you should delete `.documentation` from the `<root>/apps/` directory.
