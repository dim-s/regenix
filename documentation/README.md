fast and effective development with REST architecture.

#### PHP Framework - Fast and Easy.
Regenix is an easy-to-learn and powerful framework. PHP has a complex history of
evolution that has had an impact at all php frameworks. Many of them are
too heavy and uncomfortable, they are not easy to install and configure. Some
of them include old sources are not best quality.

#### Simple MVC Architecture
Regenix has a very simple and clear MVC architecture. Models, Controllers, Views.
The architecture of web applications is becoming more difficult from year to year.
Frameworks should have a simple and clear system to build modern applications.
